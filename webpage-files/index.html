  <h5>At the start of this class, I got a refresher on the basics of Python to solidify my skills. I learned about the different ways to use, store, and manipulate data in Python. In the days following, I learned about algorithms, which use a sequence of steps to complete a task. I started on te machine learning units a few days later, which taught me how computers can learn to recognize patterns. The projects I did used densely-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks.</h5>

  <h5>My first project was relatively straightforward. It uses a densely-connected neural network that was trained to determine a cat's place on the chonk chart based on its breed, weight, and sex. For example it would see a 5 kilogram male Turkish Angora and classify it as "He chomnk". It can do this because densely-connected neural networks can learn, similar to how humans learn. It can recognize certain patterns when it's shown certain data over and over again.</h5>

  <h5>My next project was a bit more difficult. My idea was to train a computer to identify the name of an instrument by an image of it. This would use a convolutional neural network, which breaks images down into smaller patterns that it can recognize. My first attempt involved a large dataset with a lot going on in the images. These kinds of datasets can confuse a computer and make it unable to identify patterns. When I tried to train my model on these images, it could not make accurate predictions. My solution to this problem was to find a new dataset with fewer confusing elements. All the images were on a white background, and it was just the instrument and nothing else. But even this did not give more accurate results. I tried a lot of solutions to fix this. I tried varying the data, making it more similar, and different model builds. My class figured out that the problem was a limitation of the computers. In order to train an accurate model from scratch, we would need more sophisticated hardware. Our solution was to use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for our data. This led to much more success with training.</h5>

  <h5>The final step was to make a webpage to showcase my projects. I understood the basics from the lesson plan, but I almost exclusively used ChatGPT for this part. However, I did have to work with ChatGPT and experiment a bit when errors came about. The webpage uses a server made using Flask and Python to load the models, and has input fields for entering the data you want it to predict. The page itself uses HTML for the basic elements of the webpage, CSS for the styling and aesthetic appeal, and JavaScript for the functionality.</h5>

  <h5>This class brought hardships, but I learned so much and had a lot of fun. I got to experiment with the technologies that will shape the future and saw firsthand what they can do. I had to use problem-solving skills to fix errors and improve performance. All in all, this class was educational and rewarding, and it taught me so much about how computers can learn like humans can.</h5>
